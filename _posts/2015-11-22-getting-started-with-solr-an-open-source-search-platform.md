Solr is a very popular open source search engine which builds upon the capabilities of Lucene. It&#8217;s the perfect tool to index loads of text and make it easily searchable. And it&#8217;s very fast!

Powerful features such as facets, typeahead, and &#8220;did you mean&#8221; help your users to quickly navigate through a very large dataset and find what they&#8217;re looking for.

A REST-style JSON interface makes it language-agnostic, you can even work with it straight from the command line using curl!

A flexible plugin mechanism lets you augment your searches with complementary tools such as rich document parsing, text analysis, or your own custom code.

In this session, learn the basics of making your content searchable with Solr.
