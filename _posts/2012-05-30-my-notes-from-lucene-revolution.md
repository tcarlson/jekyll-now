My notes and brainstorming from the <a href="http://lucenerevolution.org/past-events/" target="_blank">Lucene Revolution</a> conference in Cambridge, MA

# Themes

## Clustering

  * automatically search related topics that are not syntactically related (CareerBuilder example)
  * type-ahead populated by terms in the same cluster (NHS example)
  * clustering can recommend topics for a taxonomy based on content, but the user-visible labels for the topics must be hand-written/selected, there needs to be a (periodic?) human task of mapping the clusters to the taxonomy
  * some clustering algorithms (fuzzy k-means, LDA) allow for overlapping topics

## Named Entity Recognition (aka Information Extraction)

  * Use a framework such as GATE for annotating parts of speech, etc. Then need to train the system based on a domain-specific vocabulary
  * There is no OOTB solution for this, always need to implement something specific to our domain
  * There are <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData" target="_blank">some public-domain dictionaries</a> available (Wikipedia, WordNet, etc.)
  * Semantic annotation can be dictionary-based (text file) or ontology-based (OWL format)
  * Semantic Search takes this to the next level (SPARQL)

## Metadata

All the power of an intelligent search interface hinges on metadata!
  
What metadata do we have for our content?

## Recommendations

Approach the search interface as if it were a conversation to better understand what the user wants and for the user to better understand what he/she wants (travel agency example, NHS example)
  
The more we know about a user, the better recommendations we can make
  
What do we know about a user?
