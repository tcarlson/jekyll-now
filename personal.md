Happily married since 2000, father of two wonderful children. 

Living in Florida (Tampa Bay Area) since 2011, I grew up in Phoenix but spent a large portion of my life in Argentina, where I met my wife and still <a href="http://www.lamonarcaresidencia.com.ar" target="_blank">own a home</a>. I have come to the conclusion that humidity near beautiful beaches is better than &#8220;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dry+heat&#038;defid=1885836" target="_blank">dry heat</a>&#8221; in the middle of a desert.

Other interesting places I&#8217;ve spent some time:
  
The Netherlands (3 months), Dominican Republic (2 months), Paraguay (1 month), Iceland (3 weeks), Thailand, Costa Rica

In my free time (of which I can&#8217;t remember having much), I enjoy <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tcarlson/sets/homebrew" target="_blank">composing and recording music</a> in my home studio. <a href="http://gepr.net/bandlist.html" target="_blank">Progressive rock</a> is the center of my aural universe, but I can enjoy music from any genre that sounds original and creative. I appreciate complex rhythms or a nice groove, catchy or harmonized melodies, interesting orchestrations, lyrics with a profound message. Just none of that radio ga ga, please.

A follower of Jesus, but the kind that tries to <a href="http://www.sojo.net" target="_blank">love their neighbor</a> rather than judge them. I also dream of seeing the USA <a href="http://movetoamend.org/" target="_blank">become</a> a <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/" target="_blank">democracy</a>.
